The established naval powers are likely to try and domineer us if we do not act quickly, and so proposals have been created for the creation of a Polish Navy - our first real naval force since the 17th century. While our initial ships and officers are unlikely to change the world, they will be the first steps for a new branch of the Polish armed forces with a lot to prove.","isHidden":false},{"id":"POL_Grand_Shipyard_of_Gdansk","icon":"GFX_goal_generic_shipyard","prerequisiteFocusIds":["POL_Rebirth_of_Polish_Navy"],"relativePositionId":"POL_Rebirth_of_Polish_Navy","mutuallyExclusive":null,"willLeadToWarWith":null,"searchFilters":[],"x":-2,"y":1,"cost":5,"cancelIfInvalid":true,"continueIfInvalid":false,"availableIfCapitulated":false,"name":"Grand Shipyard of Gdansk","description":"The port of Gdansk was a major centre during German rule, and will likely continue to remain so now that it has been liberated. With our nascent fleet still in great need of more ships, there will be significant opportunities for the shipyards of the city to expand further, turning it into not just the principal port for Poland, but also a major entrepot for the entire Baltic - facilitating significant trade thanks to its river connections with the rest of Eastern Europe.","isHidden":false},{"id":"POL_Maritime_and_Colonial_League","icon":"GFX_focus_POL_colonial_league","prerequisiteFocusIds":["POL_Grand_Shipyard_of_Gdansk"],"relativePositionId":"POL_Rebirth_of_Polish_Navy","mutuallyExclusive":null,"willLeadToWarWith":null,"searchFilters":[],"x":-2,"y":2,"cost":5,"cancelIfInvalid":true,"continueIfInvalid":false,"availableIfCapitulated":false,"name":"Maritime and Colonial League","description":"The birth of modern global economies means that accessing vital resources often depends on being able to cross vast oceans. In order to manage all seaborne trade back to our shores, we will create a proper merchant navy, which will ensure that our industry gets whatever products and resources from overseas that it may need.","isHidden":false},{"id":"POL_Establish_Admiralty","icon":"GFX_goal_navy_hat_ships","prerequisiteFocusIds":["POL_Rebirth_of_Polish_Navy"],"relativePositionId":"POL_Rebirth_of_Polish_Navy","mutuallyExclusive":null,"willLeadToWarWith":null,"searchFilters":[],"x":1,"y":1,"cost":5,"cancelIfInvalid":true,"continueIfInvalid":false,"availableIfCapitulated":false,"name":"Establishment of the Admiralty","description":"While the first forays of the navy in safeguarding our maritime area have been broadly decent, relying on this approach in the future will make our navy an inefficient laughing stock. Like virtually all naval forces in the world, we will establish an admiralty to concentrate our naval talent, and plan how to properly allocate naval forces. This should hopefully allow us to function better as a united force rather than as a collection of ships.","isHidden":false},{"id":"POL_Ship_Acquisitions","icon":"GFX_goal_generic_coastal_navy2","prerequisiteFocusIds":["POL_Rebirth_of_Polish_Navy"],"relativePositionId":"POL_Rebirth_of_Polish_Navy","mutuallyExclusive":null,"willLeadToWarWith":null,"searchFilters":[],"x":3,"y":1,"cost":5,"cancelIfInvalid":true,"continueIfInvalid":false,"availableIfCapitulated":false,"name":"Ship Acquisitions","description":"What we need is raw numbers, and we needed them yesterday. We can solve this problem by looking to purchase surplus vessels from abroad which have outlived their usefulness for their former users. Many of these vessels can still somewhat compete however, and with a little bit of renovation and refitting, we will have ourselves a reasonably competent naval force for the moment, which matters far more than having the most modern ships at sea in the future.","isHidden":false},{"id":"POL_Protection_of_Baltic","icon":"GFX_goal_generic_baltic_sea","prerequisiteFocusIds":["POL_Establish_Admiralty","POL_Ship_Acquisitions"],"relativePositionId":"POL_Rebirth_of_Polish_Navy","mutuallyExclusive":{"focus":"POL_Hunt_and_Harass"},"willLeadToWarWith":null,"searchFilters":[],"x":0,"y":2,"cost":5,"cancelIfInvalid":true,"continueIfInvalid":false,"availableIfCapitulated":false,"name":"Protect the Baltic","description":"Unlike many other nations, we are somewhat lucky to be positioned on the Baltic - a sea which provides fewer advantages to the giant naval forces which dominate the oceans. In this inland sea, skirmish forces can prove very effective at harassing and driving off larger forces. This has led to proponents of a surface fleet pushing for the creation of a force of destroyers and minelayers, which would make any capital force wary of getting too close to our shores.","isHidden":false},{"id":"POL_Hunt_and_Harass","icon":"GFX_goal_generic_navy_submarine","prerequisiteFocusIds":["POL_Establish_Admiralty","POL_Ship_Acquisitions"],"relativePositionId":"POL_Rebirth_of_Polish_Navy","mutuallyExclusive":{"focus":"POL_Protection_of_Baltic"},"willLeadToWarWith":null,"searchFilters":[],"x":2,"y":2,"cost":5,"cancelIfInvalid":true,"continueIfInvalid":false,"availableIfCapitulated":false,"name":"Hunt and Harass","description":"Unlike many other nations, we are somewhat lucky to be positioned on the Baltic - a sea which provides fewer advantages to the giant naval forces which dominate the oceans. The few ways to escape from this sea make it perfect for using raiders and submarines, which can trap and annihilate unsuspecting forces. This line of thought is espoused by proponents of a more proactive naval stance, which will actively attack those foolish enough to try and sail their vessels on the Polish lake.","isHidden":false},{"id":"POL_Marriage_to_the_Sea","icon":"GFX_goal_generic_coastal_navy","prerequisiteFocusIds":[["POL_Hunt_and_Harass","POL_Protection_of_Baltic"],"POL_Maritime_and_Colonial_League"],"relativePositionId":"POL_Rebirth_of_Polish_Navy","mutuallyExclusive":null,"willLeadToWarWith":null,"searchFilters":[],"x":-1,"y":3,"cost":5,"cancelIfInvalid":true,"continueIfInvalid":false,"availableIfCapitulated":false,"name":"Marriage to the Sea","description":"As our fleet continues to flourish, many have brought up the old idea of a \\\"marriage to the sea\\\" - a partnership which the newly founded navy should hopefully be able to defend. Partly as a genuine strategic belief and partly as a statement of national prestige, there are those who call for the construction of a flagship for the Polish navy. A vessel which would stand as a monument to our connection to the sea, one which will never be broken again.","isHidden":false}]
