Most absurd of our failures was sending a mere 120 artillery pieces to support 875,000 men, allowing the infamous General Cadorna to send countless countrymen to die for nothing.

Formally known as the \\\"Assault Units\\\", they were among the first modern shock troops, bringing fluidity to a previously static war and carving their names into Italian legend with their exploits, despite our shameful defeat.

Luckily, such a thing is not necessary - designs for small manned craft, in the forms of torpedo \\\"chariots\\\" or motorboats, were drawn up first during the Great War, and now seem to be finding real life.
